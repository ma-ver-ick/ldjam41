# Resident Racing

Race against yourself, drive as fast as you can - but survive the zombies that are hiding in the woods. A clash between a zombie survival game (without any weapons) and a racing game. What will be your best time? Mine is `00:59.739`.
Best played in a local player build (mac/win/linux).
